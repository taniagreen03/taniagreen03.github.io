## Projects
### Decoding Customer Sentiment: Analyzing Amazon Reviews Across Product Categories 
Explored the alignment between customer-written Amazon reviews and their corresponding star ratings across various product categories. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as **VADER**, the analysis aimed to determine whether the sentiment expressed in review texts accurately reflected the numerical ratings provided by customers. 

By applying **Pearson and Spearman** correlation tests, the project uncovered instances where sentiment and star ratings diverged â€” highlighting the complexity of customer feedback and the limitations of relying solely on numerical scores for product evaluation.

**Tools & Techniques:** <br>
**Python, VADER Sentiment Analysis, Statistical Correlation (Pearson & Spearman), Data Visualization**
